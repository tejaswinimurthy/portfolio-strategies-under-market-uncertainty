# Portfolio Strategies Under Market Uncertainty

This project explores how different portfolio construction strategies behave under uncertainty, with a focus on the trade-off between theoretical optimality and real-world robustness.

The analysis compares unconstrained and constrained mean–variance portfolio strategies, evaluating their performance both in-sample and out-of-sample.
